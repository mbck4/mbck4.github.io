            <p class="body"> The main idea about the Rule of Thirds is to divide the layout into nine equal sections with the two horizontal and two vertical lines. Each of these sections will take about 33,33% of the horizontal space and the same percent of the vertical
                space. That’s why they are called “Thirds”. Intersections of the lines form focal points where the main elements of the composition should be arranged. What can be simpler: Four lines, Four intersection points, and Nine equal sections.</p>

                    Visual hierarchy is the order in which a user processes information on a page; its function in user interface (UI) design is to allow users to understand information easily. By assigning different visual characteristics to sections of information (e.g.,
                    larger fonts for headings), a designer can influence what users will perceive as being further up in the hierarchy. The visual characteristics that a designer can use to influence users’ perception of the information are: Size: the
                    larger the element, the more attention it will attract Color: bright colors are more likely to draw attention over muted ones Contrast: dramatically contrasted colors will catch the eye easily Alignment: an element that breaks away
                    from the alignment of others will attract more attention Repetition: repeating styles can give the impression that content is related Proximity: closely placed elements will also appear related Whitespace: more space around elements
                    will attract the eye toward them Texture and style: richer textures will attract more attention than flat ones
